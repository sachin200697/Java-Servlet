JSP : It is an extension of servlet. But provide more functionality.

We can create web pages with extension: index.jsp

In jsp pages, we can write html, css, js, java.


## JSP Tags:

1. Comment tag: We can make a comment using belwo tag:
    <%-- 
        Document   : first
        Created on : Apr 27, 2022, 4:39:17 PM
        Author     : sachink1
    --%>

2. Declaration tag: to declate variables and methods.
    <%!
        Variables;
        Methods;
    %>

3. Scriptlet tag: We can write any cade that we can write in service method of servlet. We can process the  
                  request inside this tag.
    <%
        out.println(a);     //out is the PrintWriter object created by jsp automatically.
        out.println(b);
    %>

4. Expression tag: Instead of writing out.println in Scriptlet tag, we can use expression tag directly.
    <h1> <%= name %> </h1>

5. Declarative tag: To give the instruction how to give direction to jsp pages. There are three types of 
                    directive tags:
(a) Page Directive: Using page directive, we can tell the things that will be apply on whole page.
                    We can use it anywhere on the page.
Ex:
    <%@page import="java.util.Random, java.util.ArrayList, java.io.*" %>

    //using scriptlet tag
    <%
        Random r = new Random();   //6 is the upperbound to generate a number.
        int n = r.nextInt();
        out.print(n);
    %>


(b) Include Directive: To include other jsp file.
    Ex: 
        <%@include file="header.jsp">



(c) Taglib Directive: To include other library predefined tags. To do this:
    1. Add jar file of the library. For example add mysql jar file. NetBeans bydefault provides some
       library, so most of the time instead of adding jar file, we can simply add library.
       From example add JSTL library -> right click on Library folder -> add lilbrary -> choose library

    2. Use tage:
        <%@taglib prefix="c" uri="http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/core"%>         
       
       uri: "http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/core"  //for core 
       uri: "http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/sql"  //for sql 
       uri: "http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/fmt"  //for format
    
    3. How to use:
        <c:set var="name" value="Sachin Kumar"></c:set>         //here c is defined in 2'nd step

        <c:out value="${name}"></c:out>

        <c:if test="${3>4}">
            <h1>Condition is true</h1>
        </c:if>
