## Steps:

1. NeatBeans -> window -> services -> servers -> add server -> 
2. give a name like Apache Tomcat1 (we can add many servers)->
3. Browser the path of Tomcat directory:-> C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 9.0
    (path of parent of bin folder of tomcat in program files)-> 
    
    To complete this step successfully user should have all the permissions. If user is not added then 
    first add user and provide all authorities.
4. provide username and password of Tomcat (username: sachin)
5. Finish (may ask username and password again)


To start and stor the server:
NetBeans -> window -> services -> server -> select one of server(Apache Tomcat1) -> right click -> start/stop


Not in NetBeans id:
OR to Start/Stop directly from tomcat -> press window -> search tomcat -> open Monitor Tomcat -> Start/Stop
